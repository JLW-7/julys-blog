Hey, I’m July—part-time coder, full-time overthinker. I spend most of my time either writing code, swimming laps, or staring at the night sky wondering if aliens think we’re weird (we totally are).

This blog is where I dump my brain—expect coding tutorials, deep thoughts on astronomy and math, random experiments, and the occasional questionable life decision disguised as a project. If I find it interesting, I’ll probably write about it. If it breaks my brain, I’ll definitely write about it.

When I’m not debugging code, you’ll probably find me attempting to break the sound barrier in a swimming pool or trying (and failing) to train my dog to fetch snacks for me.

Stick around. It’ll be fun. Or at least mildly entertaining 😏. Oh btw check out [julyw.com](https://julyw.com/) and follow me on [Github](https://github.com/JLW-7).
