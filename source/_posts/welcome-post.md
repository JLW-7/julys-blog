Welcome to my blog! I am July Wu, a student full-stack-developer from Shanghai, China. Learn more about me  [here](/about) or visit my website [julyw.com](https://julyw.com/). 

## What is this for?

I regularly make updates and write articles here. Usually, they're about stuff I find interesting, tutorials for a lot of different things (coding, astronomy, math...anything), or just random thoughts/experiences. Hope you have fun here!



> Btw, if you like what I write/make/believe, feel free to connect with me! (Links are on your left)
